Logistic regression: accuracy training set = 90.23% (90% data set); dev set = 88% (10% data set)  -> Avoidable bias (estimated baye's error = 0%) = 9.77%; variance = 2.23%\
Neural Network: accuracy training set = 98.92% (90% data set); dev set = 96.98% (10% data set) -> Avoidable bias = 1.18%; variance = 1.96%\
Gradient Boosting: accuracy training set = 76.4% (90% data set); dev set = 75.8% (10% data set) -> Avoidable bias = 23.6%; variance = 0.6%  
Convolutional Neural Networks: accuracy training set = 99.38% (90% data set); dev set = 98.26 (10% data set) -> Avoidable bias = 0.62%; variance = 0.12%
